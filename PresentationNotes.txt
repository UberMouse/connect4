					Friday 	10:30	Decision to refactor to MVC and focus on testing rather than implement multiplayer
									
									Pairing Structure	- Gen+Melissa on presentation
														- Mike+Taylor on despaghettifying code
														------ Group decision to Abandon MVC - pivot to MVM!! -
														Possible but too hard to maintain game state between files ------
														------ focus on integration testing + unit tests to debug winning algorithm -------
